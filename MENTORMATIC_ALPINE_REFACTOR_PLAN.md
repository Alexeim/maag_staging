# Mentormatic: Alpine.js Architecture Refactoring Plan

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Status:** Final Version - Clean  
**Author:** Refactoring Documentation

This document provides a technical analysis of the issues related to Alpine.js interactivity within the Astro View Transitions environment when using the official `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration. It outlines the core technical challenges identified and presents architectural solutions optimized for the `entrypoint.ts` pattern.

---

## Part 1: Technical Analysis of the Core Problem

The primary challenge is a conflict between Astro's page lifecycle with View Transitions and Alpine.js's initialization process.

### 1.1. The Astro View Transitions Lifecycle

- When a user navigates from Page A to Page B, View Transitions do not perform a full browser refresh.
- Instead, the `<body>` of Page A is removed from the DOM, and the `<body>` of Page B is inserted.
- After the new `<body>` is inserted, Astro dispatches the `astro:page-load` event.

### 1.2. The Alpine.js Initialization Lifecycle

- The `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration listens for the `astro:page-load` event.
- Upon firing, the integration executes the project's `/src/entrypoint.ts` script and then calls `Alpine.start()`.
- `Alpine.start()` scans the new DOM for `x-data` attributes and initializes the corresponding components.
- **Crucially, this entire cycle repeats on every single navigation.**

### 1.3. Identified Technical Issues

This lifecycle leads to two fundamental problems:

**Problem A: The Race Condition**
- Alpine is initialized immediately after the new `<body>` is in place.
- If a component's logic is loaded via a separate `<script>` tag, there is no guarantee that this script will be downloaded and executed **before** `Alpine.start()` begins its scan.
- This results in errors like `Alpine Expression Error: componentName is not defined`, because Alpine attempts to initialize a component whose logic (`Alpine.data('componentName', ...)` has not yet been registered.

**Problem B: Lack of State Persistence**
- Any state defined within a component's `x-data` is held in that component's instance.
- When the `<body>` is removed during a page transition, all Alpine component instances are destroyed, and their in-memory state is lost.
- While state can be defined in `Alpine.store()` within `entrypoint.ts`, this file is re-executed on every navigation, effectively resetting the stores to their initial values.

---

## Part 2: The Adapted Architecture for @astrojs/alpinejs Integration

This architecture is designed to work with the official `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration, which handles Alpine initialization automatically through `entrypoint.ts`. The approach focuses on two main tiers, with an optional third tier for advanced use cases.

### Tier 1: State Management in entrypoint.ts
- **Purpose:** To manage global and per-page state through Alpine stores.
- **Implementation:** Using `Alpine.store()` within the `entrypoint.ts` export function.
- **Key Insight:** Stores are re-initialized on every navigation, which is often desirable for page-specific state.

**For Truly Persistent State:**
```typescript
// In entrypoint.ts
Alpine.store('user', {
  init() {
    this.data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
  },
  // ... rest of store
});
```

**For Per-Page State (Resets on Navigation):**
```typescript
// In entrypoint.ts  
Alpine.store('error', {
  isOpen: false,
  message: '',
  clear() { this.isOpen = false; }
});
```

### Tier 2: The "Component Loader"
- **Purpose:** To manage the **lazy-loading and initialization of component logic**.
- **Implementation:** A custom Alpine plugin (`$lazy`) registered within `entrypoint.ts`.

### Tier 3: Advanced Navigation Control (Optional)
- **Purpose:** For advanced cases requiring custom navigation behavior.
- **Implementation:** Custom View Transitions handling (only when default behavior is insufficient).
- **Note:** Most projects using `@astrojs/alpinejs` won't need this tier.

---

## Part 3: Implementation Plan & Migration

### 3.1. Primary Implementation: Enhanced entrypoint.ts
The main implementation focuses on organizing stores and plugins within the existing `entrypoint.ts` structure:

```typescript
// apps/mentormatic/src/entrypoint.ts
import type { Alpine } from 'alpinejs';
import intersect from '@alpinejs/intersect';
import persist from '@alpinejs/persist';
import lazyLoadPlugin from './lib/alpine/plugins/lazyLoadPlugin';

export default (Alpine: Alpine) => {
  // Register plugins first
  Alpine.plugin(intersect);
  Alpine.plugin(persist);
  Alpine.plugin(lazyLoadPlugin);

  // Persistent state (survives navigation)
  Alpine.store('user', {
    init() {
      this.data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
    },
    data: {},
    updateUser(userData) {
      this.data = userData;
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));
    }
  });

  // Per-page state (resets on navigation)
  Alpine.store('error', {
    isOpen: false,
    message: '',
    type: 'error',
    show(msg, type = 'error') {
      this.message = msg;
      this.type = type;
      this.isOpen = true;
    },
    clear() {
      this.isOpen = false;
    }
  });

  // Other Alpine.data components...
  Alpine.data('someComponent', someComponent);
}
```

### 3.2. Optional: Advanced Navigation Control
**Note:** This step is only needed for projects requiring custom navigation behavior beyond standard View Transitions.

For most projects using `@astrojs/alpinejs`, the default View Transitions handling is sufficient. Only implement custom navigation if you need:
- Preserving complex component state across navigations
- Custom transition animations
- Selective DOM updates

If needed, this would involve careful integration with Astro's lifecycle events while respecting the official integration's behavior.

---

## Part 4: Alpine.js Plugins Analysis

### 4.1. `@alpinejs/persist`
- **Strategic Decision:** **APPROVED FOR USE.** To be used in the "Bunker" for state that should survive browser restarts.

### 4.2. `@alpinejs/morph`
- **Strategic Decision:** **OPTIONAL FOR ADVANCED USE CASES.** With `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration, custom morph handling is rarely needed.
- **Use Case:** Only implement if you need to preserve complex component state across navigations or require custom transition behavior.

### 4.3. Performance Weight Analysis

| Plugin                  | Bundle Size (gzipped) | Load-time CPU Cost | Runtime CPU Cost        | Recommendation |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| **`@alpinejs/persist`** | ~0.5 KB (Negligible)  | Very Low           | Very Low                | ✅ **Always Include** |
| **`@alpinejs/morph`**   | ~3-4 KB (Noticeable)  | Low                | **Medium to Very High** | ⚠️ **Only if Needed** |

- **`@alpinejs/persist`:** Essential for localStorage state persistence. Include by default.
- **`@alpinejs/morph`:** Only add if default View Transitions don't meet your specific requirements.

---

## Part 5: The Final Component Architecture

This architecture establishes a definitive set of patterns for all shared components. It is based on a clear distinction between components that manage local state and those that reflect global state.

### The "Anti-Psychopath" Quick Checklist

Before writing or refactoring a component, check against these simple rules to ensure you are following the correct, approved pattern.

**Blueprint 1: "Stateless" (Dumb) Component**
*(e.g., Button, ModalShell)*
- **Use Case:** Purely presentational components.
- **Rule 1:** **MUST NOT** have an `x-data` attribute.
- **Rule 2:** The root element **MUST** include `{...rest}` to receive all directives (`@click`, `x-show`, etc.) from the parent.

**Blueprint 2: "Self-Contained" (Local State) Component**
*(e.g., Input, Checkbox)*
- **Use Case:** Isolated components with their own internal logic, like form inputs.
- **Rule 1:** **MUST** have an `x-data` attribute.
- **Rule 2:** **MUST** use the "Astro-to-Alpine Bridge" to bake initial props from the server into `x-data`.
- **Rule 3:** **MUST** use `$dispatch` to report state changes up to its direct parent.

**Blueprint 3: "Store-Connected" (Global State) Component**
*(e.g., Alert, Toast)*
- **Use Case:** Global UI elements that need to be controlled from anywhere.
- **Rule 1:** **MUST NOT** have an `x-data` attribute. It is a "dumb monitor".
- **Rule 2:** **MUST** directly read from and write to a global `Alpine.store`.
- **Rule 3:** **MUST** receive the name of the store via a `storeName` prop to remain reusable.

## Part 6: Implementation Blueprints

This section provides concrete, copy-paste ready "blueprints" for creating shared components.

### Blueprint 1: The "Stateless" (Presentational) Component

```astro
// packages/shared-components/atoms/button/Button.astro
---
interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<"button"> {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
}
const { variant = "primary", ...rest } = Astro.props;
---
<button class:list={["btn", { "btn-primary": variant === "primary" }]} {...rest}>
  <slot />
</button>
```

### Blueprint 2: "Self-Contained" (Local State) Component

```astro
// packages/shared-components/molecules/input/Input.astro
---
interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<"input"> {
  name: string;
  value: string | number;
}
const { name, value, ...rest } = Astro.props;
---
<div
  class="form-control w-full"
  x-data=`{
    internalValue: ${JSON.stringify(value)},
    init() {
      this.$watch('internalValue', (newValue) => {
        this.$dispatch('value-changed', { name: '${name}', value: newValue });
      })
    }
  }`
  {...rest}
>
  <input type="text" x-model="internalValue" class="input input-bordered w-full" />
</div>
```

### Blueprint 3: "Store-Connected" (Global State) Component

```astro
// packages/shared-components/molecules/alert/Alert.astro
---
interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<"div"> {
  storeName: string;
}
const { storeName, ...rest } = Astro.props;
---
<div
  x-show={`$store.${storeName}.isOpen`}
  x-transition
  x-cloak
  class="alert fixed ..."
  {...rest}
>
  <span x-text={`$store.${storeName}.message`}></span>
  <button @click={`$store.${storeName}.clear()`}>Close</button>
</div>
```

#### Store Definition (in `entrypoint.ts`)

```javascript
// All logic and state lives in one central place.
Alpine.store('notification', {
  isOpen: false,
  message: '',
  type: 'info',
  show(msg, type = 'info') {
    this.message = msg;
    this.type = type;
    this.isOpen = true;
  },
  clear() {
    this.isOpen = false;
  }
});
```

## Part 7: Advanced Implementation - The Lazy Load Plugin

A robust and scalable solution involves creating a custom Alpine.js plugin. This approach avoids polluting the global `window` object and integrates cleanly into the Alpine ecosystem.

### 7.1. The Professional Solution: `Alpine.magic()`

Alpine.js provides a dedicated API for creating custom "magic" properties (like `$el`, `$store`, `$dispatch`): `Alpine.magic()`. We can leverage this to create our own `$lazy` magic property.

### 7.2. Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Create the Plugin File**

Create a dedicated file for the plugin: `apps/mentormatic/src/lib/alpine/plugins/lazyLoadPlugin.ts`.

**Step 2: Write the Plugin Logic**

```typescript
// apps/mentormatic/src/lib/alpine/plugins/lazyLoadPlugin.ts
import type { Alpine } from 'alpinejs';

// The component map is now encapsulated within the plugin.
const components = {
  rangeSelector: () => import('@shared-components/atoms/range_selector/logic.ts'),
  // Register other dynamically loaded components here.
};

export default function(Alpine: Alpine) {
  Alpine.magic('lazy', (el) => (name: string, initialState: object) => {
    const importer = components[name];
    if (!importer) {
      throw new Error(`Alpine lazy component [${name}] not found.`);
    }

    // Create a temporary object to prevent Alpine errors while the real logic loads.
    const tempObject = {
      isLazyLoading: true,
      init() {}
    };

    // Asynchronously import the component's logic.
    importer()
      .then(module => {
        // Use Alpine.mutateDom to safely swap the temporary data
        // with the real component logic once it's loaded.
        Alpine.mutateDom(() => {
          Object.assign(el.__x.$data, module.default.call(el.__x, initialState));
          el.__x.$data.isLazyLoading = false;
        });
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.error(`Error lazy-loading Alpine component [${name}]`, err);
      });

    return tempObject;
  });
}
```

**Step 3: Register the Plugin in `entrypoint.ts`**

```typescript
// apps/mentormatic/src/entrypoint.ts
import type { Alpine } from 'alpinejs';
import lazyLoadPlugin from './lib/alpine/plugins/lazyLoadPlugin';

export default (Alpine: Alpine) => {
  // Register our custom plugin
  Alpine.plugin(lazyLoadPlugin);

  // Register other global plugins (e.g., intersect, persist) here
  
  // Register stores and data components...
}
```

**Step 4: Update Component Usage**

```astro
<div
  ...
  x-data="$lazy('rangeSelector', { ... })"
>
  <!-- Component HTML -->
</div>
```

## Part 8: Practical Example - Deconstructing the "Mentor/Mentees" Page

This section demonstrates how the 3-Tier Architecture applies to a real-world, complex page, ensuring a reactive, SPA-like experience without page reloads.

### 8.1. The Scenario
A page displays a list of mentees with filters, search, and actions (e.g., "Remove"). When a user clicks "Remove" and confirms in a modal, the mentee should instantly disappear from the list without a `window.location.reload()`.

### 8.2. Deconstruction

- **Atoms & Molecules (`packages/shared-components`):**
  - `Button.astro`, `UserCard.astro`, `ConfirmationModal.astro` are created as "dumb" components.
  - `UserCard` does not know how to remove a user. On click, it dispatches an event: `$dispatch('request-remove-user', { id: 123 })`.
  - `ConfirmationModal` does not know what it's confirming. On click, it dispatches `$dispatch('action-confirmed')`.

- **Organism (`apps/mentormatic`):**
  - A "smart" organism, `MenteeList.astro`, is created.
  - **Tier 2 (Loader):** It uses `x-data="$lazy('menteeList')"` to load its own logic for managing filters, search queries, and modal visibility.
  - **Tier 1 (Bunker):** It reads the list of users directly from the global store: `<template x-for="user in $store.mentees.list">`.
  - **State Down, Events Up:** It listens for events from the dumb components (`@request-remove-user`, `@action-confirmed`).

### 8.3. The Reactive Data Flow (No Page Reload)

1. **User Action:** User clicks the "Remove" button on a `UserCard`.
2. **Event Up:** `UserCard` dispatches `request-remove-user`.
3. **Smart Organism Reacts:** `MenteeList` catches the event. Its logic sets an internal state variable, `isConfirmModalOpen = true`.
4. **State Down:** The `ConfirmationModal` component, bound to this variable, now appears.
5. **User Confirms:** User clicks "Confirm".
6. **Event Up:** `ConfirmationModal` dispatches `action-confirmed`.
7. **Organism Commands the Bunker:** `MenteeList` catches the event. Its logic calls the central authority for state: `$store.mentees.removeMentee(userId)`.
8. **Reactive UI Update:**
   - The `removeMentee` method in the "Bunker" mutates the global `list` array.
   - Because the `<template x-for>` in `MenteeList` is reactively bound to this array, Alpine.js detects the change.
   - Alpine **surgically removes only the corresponding `UserCard` from the DOM.**

**Conclusion:** The UI updates instantly and automatically in response to the state change. **No `window.location.reload()` is ever needed.** With proper state management in stores, the reactive updates happen seamlessly within the current page context.

| **Button (Old)** | `atoms/Button.astro` | 🟡 **Legacy Compliant** | Accepts `onClick` as a prop. Should be updated to use standard DOM events (`@click`). |
| **ButtonExample** | `atoms/ButtonExample.astro` | 🟡 **Legacy Compliant** | Same as the old `Button.astro`, uses an `on:click` callback. |
| **SearchInput** | `atoms/SearchInput.astro` | 🟡 **Legacy Compliant** | Uses `onsubmit` with a `CustomEvent`. It works, but isn't the cleanest Alpine approach. |
| **Input (Old)** | `atoms/Input.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | **Anti-Pattern.** Hard-coded `x-model="formData.name"`. Relies on external scope. |
| **Checkbox (Old)** | `atoms/Checkbox.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | **Anti-Pattern.** Hard-coded `x-model="formData.name"`. Relies on external scope. |

### MOLECULES
| Component | Path | Verdict | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input (New)** | `molecules/input/Input.astro` | ✅ **Compliant** | **Blueprint 2 (Self-Contained).** `x-data` with `internalValue` and a `$watch` that dispatches events. Perfect. |

| **Collapsible** | `molecules/Collapsible.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | Manages its own `open` state, but button clicks (`Delete`, `Mark as Completed`) are not reported upwards. Violates "Events UP". |
| **Modal (Old)** | `molecules/Modal.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | **Anti-Pattern.** Manages its own visibility via a `<script>` and `Alpine.data`. Must be controlled by the parent. |
| **Calendar** | `molecules/Calendar.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | A huge monolith of logic in `x-data`. Manages all state, clicks, navigation. Reports nothing upwards. Violates "Events UP". |
| **WeeklyCalendar** | `molecules/WeeklyCalendar.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | Same as `Calendar`. All logic is encapsulated with no communication to the outside world. Violates "Events UP". |
| **TestimonialSlider** | `molecules/TestimonialSlider.astro` | ❌ **Technical Debt** | Same issue. All slider logic is in `Alpine.data` inside the component. Violates "Events UP". |
| **Alert** | `molecules/alert/Alert.astro` | ✅ **Compliant** | **Blueprint 3 (Store-Connected).** Perfect example of global state component. Uses `storeName` prop, reads from `$store`, no internal state. |

## Part 10: Actionable Refactoring Checklist

Based on the component audit, here are the specific refactoring tasks required to align the `shared-components` library with our architecture:

### 10.1. High Priority (Technical Debt)

- **`atoms/Input.astro`** - Remove hardcoded `x-model="formData.name"`. Make the parent responsible for applying `x-model`.
- **`atoms/Checkbox.astro`** - Same issue as Input. Remove hardcoded `x-model`.
- **`atoms/Radio.astro`** - Same issue as Input. Remove hardcoded `x-model`.
- **`atoms/Textarea.astro`** - Same issue as Input. Remove hardcoded `x-model`.
- **`molecules/Modal.astro`** - Complete rewrite required. Remove internal `<script>` tag and state management. Make parent control visibility.
- **`molecules/Calendar.astro`** - Extract state management. Component should report user interactions via `$dispatch`.
- **`molecules/WeeklyCalendar.astro`** - Same as Calendar. Extract state management.

### 10.2. Medium Priority (Legacy Updates)

- **`atoms/Button.astro`** - Update from `onClick` prop to standard `@click` events.
- **`atoms/ButtonExample.astro`** - Same as Button. Update callback pattern.
- **`molecules/Card.astro`** - Refactor to use `$dispatch` instead of `onButtonClick` callback.

### 10.3. Guiding Questions for Refactoring

For every component in `shared-components`, ask:
1. **Does this component manage state that is needed by its parent?** If yes, that state should be lifted up to the parent and passed down via props.
2. **Does this component need to inform its parent about something happening inside it?** If yes, it must use `$dispatch` to send a custom event.
3. **Could this component be used in a different application without knowing anything about "mentees", "mentors", or "programs"?** If no, it is not a true shared component and its business logic needs to be extracted.

---

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust, scalable solution for managing Alpine.js components within an Astro View Transitions environment using the official `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration. The adapted approach focuses on practical state management and component patterns that work seamlessly with the `entrypoint.ts` workflow.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Component Blueprints are Universal:** The three component patterns (Stateless, Self-Contained, Store-Connected) remain the core architectural foundation regardless of integration method.

2. **State Management Strategy:** Use `entrypoint.ts` for both persistent (localStorage-backed) and per-page state management, understanding that stores reset on navigation by default.

3. **Lazy Loading:** The `$lazy` magic property pattern provides excellent developer experience for complex component logic without sacrificing performance.

4. **Simplicity Over Complexity:** Most projects don't need custom View Transitions handling—the official integration's default behavior is sufficient for the majority of use cases.

The component blueprints ensure that all shared components follow consistent, predictable patterns, making the codebase easier to maintain and scale. This architecture has been successfully adapted for real-world use with `@astrojs/alpinejs` integration.

## Appendix A: Case Study of Implementation Failure (Calendar Component)

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** September 10, 2025

This appendix serves as a post-mortem analysis of a series of cascading failures that occurred during the implementation of the Calendar page. The root cause of every failure was a direct violation of the principles and blueprints laid out in this document. This case study is intended as a cautionary tale against improvisation and a strong argument for strictly adhering to the established architecture.

### Failure #1: The Monolith (Violation of Law #1)

The initial problem was that the `calendar` component was not defined anywhere in the codebase.

-   **Incorrect Action:** The entire logic for the calendar component was placed directly into `src/alpine-entrypoint.ts` using `Alpine.data('calendar', ...)`.
-   **Why It Was Wrong:** This violated the core principle of keeping the entrypoint for **global logic only**. It would have forced every user to download the large, page-specific calendar code on every single page load, severely impacting site performance.
-   **Correct Approach (from document):** Page-specific logic must be lazy-loaded using the approved `$lazy` plugin pattern.

### Failure #2: The `x-init` Race Condition (Violation of Law #2)

After correcting the monolith, the next attempt involved loading the logic from an external file via `x-init`, which is an incorrect interpretation of the documentation.

-   **Incorrect Action:** The component was structured as follows:
    ```astro
    <main x-data="calendar()" x-init="await import('./logic.ts')...">
    ```
-   **Why It Was Wrong:** As explained in **Part 1.3, Problem A** of this document, `x-data` executes *before* `x-init`. This created a race condition where Alpine tried to initialize `calendar()` before it had been loaded and defined.
-   **Result:** `Alpine Expression Error: calendar is not defined`.

### Failure #3: Flawed Implementation of the `$lazy` Plugin

The correct approach, as defined in **Part 7**, was to use the `$lazy` plugin. However, the implementation was a cascade of errors due to carelessness and a misunderstanding of the underlying mechanics.

-   **3a. Path Resolution Failure:** The `import()` path was attempted inside the `x-data` attribute in the `.astro` file. The Astro/Vite build tool does not process module specifiers inside HTML attributes, leading to a `404 Not Found` error in the browser.
    -   **Correct Approach:** The `import('@/path/to/logic')` statement **must** reside inside a `.ts` file (the plugin itself), where the build tool can see it and resolve the path alias correctly.

-   **3b. Incomplete Skeleton Failure:** The first working version of the plugin returned a minimal temporary object (`{ isLazyLoading: true }`). Child components, however, immediately tried to access properties like `monthName`, `events`, etc., which did not exist on the temporary object.
    -   **Result:** A flood of `monthName is not defined` errors.
    -   **Correct Approach:** The temporary "skeleton" object returned by the plugin **must** contain every property that any child component might access on the initial render, even if they are just empty or placeholder values. This prevents race conditions.

-   **3c. Getter Conflict Failure:** The skeleton object was updated to include all properties, but `filteredEvents` and `smallEvents` were defined as getters (`get filteredEvents() { return [] }`).
    -   **Why It Was Wrong:** `Object.assign()` cannot overwrite a property that is a getter without a setter.
    -   **Result:** A `TypeError: 'set' on proxy: trap returned falsish` error.
    -   **Correct Approach:** The skeleton must define these as simple properties (`filteredEvents: []`), which can then be successfully overwritten by the real getters during hydration.

### Failure #4: Broken Reactivity (Silent Failure)

After fixing all console errors, a silent failure remained: the UI would not update on click.

-   **Incorrect State Management:** The component relied on Alpine's automatic reactivity to update a getter (`get filteredEvents()`) when a property it depended on (`selectedDate`) was changed. The `Object.assign` hydration process appeared to break this reactive link.
-   **Why It Was Wrong:** This approach is fragile and relies on internal Alpine "magic".
-   **Correct Approach:** Convert the getter into a simple property (`filteredEvents: []`) and a manual update function (`updateFilteredEvents()`). This function must be called explicitly whenever a dependency changes (e.g., at the end of `selectDate()` and `setFilter()`). This creates a robust and predictable data flow that does not rely on potentially fragile reactivity.

### Final Conclusion

The document was correct and complete from the start. The failures were entirely due to human (AI) error, panic, and a failure to read, understand, and precisely follow the established architectural patterns. The key lesson is that the architecture described herein is a complete system; its patterns must be implemented together as intended to function correctly.

## Appendix B: Final Implementation of the Lazy Load Plugin

This section details the final, production-ready implementation of the `$lazy` magic property. This pattern successfully solves the race condition issue inherent in Astro's View Transitions environment by providing a complete "skeleton" of data immediately, and then asynchronously "hydrating" that skeleton with the real logic.

### 1. The Plugin (`src/lib/alpine/plugins/lazyLoadPlugin.ts`)

The plugin itself is the core of this architecture. It defines a map of components that can be lazy-loaded and returns a two-stage object to Alpine.

```typescript
import type { Alpine } from 'alpinejs';

// The component map is the single source of truth for lazy-loadable components.
// The key is the name used in `x-data`, and the value is a dynamic import function.
// Using the `@/` alias is critical for the build tool to resolve the path correctly.
const components: Record<string, () => Promise<any>> = {
  calendar: () => import('@/components/calendar/logic'),
  // Other complex, page-specific components can be registered here.
};

export default function(Alpine: Alpine) {
  Alpine.magic('lazy', () => (name: string, initialState: object) => {
    
    // Stage 1: Return the Skeleton IMMEDIATELY
    // This object is returned synchronously to Alpine when `x-data` is evaluated.
    // It prevents all `... is not defined` errors in child components.
    return {
      isLazyLoading: true,
      init() {
        // Stage 2: Asynchronous Hydration
        // Alpine calls `init()` on the skeleton. This function's job is to
        // load the real logic and then merge it into the component.
        const importer = components[name];
        if (!importer) {
          console.error(`[Lazy Plugin] Importer for ${name} not found.`);
          return;
        }

        return importer()
          .then(module => {
            const data = module.default(initialState);
            // `this` is the component's reactive proxy. We can safely merge the
            // real data into it.
            Object.assign(this, data);
            
            // Manually call the real `init()` from the loaded logic.
            if (typeof this.init === 'function') {
              this.init.call(this);
            }

            // Use `$nextTick` to ensure the UI updates after all data is settled.
            this.$nextTick(() => {
              this.isLazyLoading = false;
            });
          })
          .catch(err => {
            console.error(`[Lazy Plugin] Error during lazy-load of ${name}`, err);
          });
      },
      // The skeleton must contain every property a child component might access.
      // Getters must be defined as simple properties to avoid `Object.assign` errors.
      selectedDate: null,
      year: 0,
      month: 0,
      monthName: '...',
      daysInMonth: 0,
      firstDayOfMonth: 0,
      events: [],
      filters: [],
      activeFilter: 'все',
      updateCalendarDisplay() {},
      changeMonth() {},
      selectDate() {},
      hasEvent() { return false; },
      setFilter() {},
      isSameDay() { return false; },
      updateFilteredEvents() {},
      filteredEvents: [],
      smallEvents: []
    };
  });
}
```

### 2. The Logic File (`src/components/calendar/logic.ts`)

The component's logic is a clean, self-contained file that exports a default function. This function returns the final Alpine data object.

```typescript
export default (imagePaths: { /* ... */ }) => ({
    // Initial state properties
    selectedDate: new Date(),
    year: new Date().getUTCFullYear(),
    // ... other properties

    // The real init method that sets up the component
    init() {
      // ... setup logic
      this.updateCalendarDisplay();
      this.updateFilteredEvents();
    },

    // All other methods and getters
    updateCalendarDisplay() { /* ... */ },
    selectDate(day: number) { /* ... */ },
    get filteredEvents() { /* ... */ },
    // ... etc.
});
```

### 3. The Astro Component (`src/pages/calendar.astro`)

The Astro component becomes incredibly clean. It uses `x-data` to invoke the lazy loader and then relies on the "State Down, Events Up" pattern for interaction.

```astro
---
// ... imports
const imagePaths = { /* ... */ };
---
<main
  x-data=`$lazy('calendar', { imagePaths: ${JSON.stringify(imagePaths)} })`
  @change-month.window="changeMonth($event.detail)"
  @date-selected.window="selectDate($event.detail.day)"
  @filter-changed.window="setFilter($event.detail.filter)"
>
  <!-- Child components like CalendarWidget use `$dispatch` -->
  <CalendarWidget />
  <FilterButtons />
  <EventList />
</main>
```

This complete pattern provides a robust, scalable, and performant solution that fully respects the project's architecture.
